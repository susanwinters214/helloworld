Changing some text in the readme file - branched off the master.

I find the whole GitHub process to be similiar to a team using SharePoint 2013. 

SharePoint: A person checks out a web page, edits the content of the page, and then "checks in" the page. 
When you check a file in, you get a pop up box that gives you a textarea to type in a description of the change you made.

Github: In github you create a branch (like SP's checking out) and edit the page. Then instead of "checking in" the changes you "commit" the changes. 

NEXT

SharePoint: The edited version of the page sits there until an Admin reviews the changes and clicks the approve button which makes your new content overwrite the existing content.

Github: In github you open a pull request. (You are proposing your changes and requesting that someone review and pull in your contribution and merge them into their branch.
