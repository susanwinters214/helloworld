Changing some text in the readme file - branched off the master.
I find the whole GitHub process to be similiar to a team using SharePoint 2013. A person checks out the page, then edits the content of the page and then "checks in" the page. In SP2013, when you check a file in, you get a box that pops up where you type in a description of the change you made on the page and then click the OK button. In github you create a branch (like SP's checking out) and work on your own copy. Then instead of "checking in" you "commit" the changes.
